Workflow for IO-Detector evaluation :

Run :
~/cita/activity-detection/shell-scripts/runIOExpts.sh and change things there manually.

Was able to replicate results from the last time that I ran this (Dec 2012).

New results :
=====================================================================
Allow WiFi scans to go from 5 seconds all the way to 60 seconds, but no more or less.
More : Hits accuracy.
Less : Hits energy.

[1,2]    95.0 0.9 2588  0 
[1]      86.1 2.3 1646  131 
[2]      82.8 2.3 1536  113 

Next algorithm :
Allow WiFi scans to go from 10 seconds all the way to 60 seconds, but no more or less :

[1,2]    94.1 0.9 1705  0 
[1]      85.8 2.1 1285  62 
[2]      81.2 2.2 1227  52

Next algorithm :
I think a simple fixed sampling rate of 20 seconds will work well enough.

[1,2]    90.9 0.8 1261  0 
[1]      90.9 0.8 1261  0 
[2]      90.9 0.8 1261  0 

Current algorithm :
Avg RSSI and Fraction APs above threshold. Train on the Dec 3rd data and test on Dec 6th data from another phone.
No upper or lower watermark of 0.2.
Vary sampling rate according to user's latency specification.
Don't do anything based on the callback specification, because there are only two callbacks.

Fleshing out the details :
1. Set Sampling interval to one-fourth of user requested latency.
2. Set Micro window size to approx. one-half of user requested latency.
3. Set Macro window size to approx. user requested latency.
4. Set bin size in stats.py to the user requested latency.
5. No adaptation based on callbacks or detected user state.
