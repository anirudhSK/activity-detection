1. Handle timestamps not being in order due to non-monotonic clock.
2. When using stitch-traces.py, make sure that the entire trace file has a single ground truth or prune if it's not that way. I guess we could just do this manually and create a bunch of really clean trace files.
3. Write the latency calculation code.
4. Fit a Gaussian to the feature vector distributions. Experiment with other distributions as well.
5. Write the classifier code in classify.py
6. Allow the simulator to swap in different implementations of the classifier.
